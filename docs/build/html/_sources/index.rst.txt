PyFibreBundle
====================================
PyFibreBundle is a Python library for image processing of fibre bundle images. It is being developed mainly by `Mike Hughes <https://research.kent.ac.uk/applied-optics/hughes/>`_ at the `Applied Optics Group <https://research.kent.ac.uk/applied-optics>`_, University of Kent, but contributions and pull requests are welcome.

This library is currently under development and there is no stable release. Some functions require the OpenCV library. The library is designed to be fast enough for use in imaging GUIs as well as for offline research.
